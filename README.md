This is a business card I created as part of a project "challenge" by mdn. It is under the "CSS styling basics" course.

Some challenges which I learned from were:
<ul>
    <li>How to calculate and incorporate the em value</li>
    <li>Specificity</li>
    <li>Color opacity (using rgba)</li>
    <li>line-height property</li>
</ul>
